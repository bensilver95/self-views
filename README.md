# Self-views and memory across the 2020 U.S. presidential election

This is the repository for the paper titled “Did I really used to be like that?” Self-views and memory across the 2020 U.S. presidential election. In this repository, you can find the R analysis script and all of the data that goes into the analysis script, in the form of cleaned .csv files from Qualtrics surveys. If you'd like to view and work with the .RData file, which includes all models and figures, you can find that on the [OSF]() page.

Here is a description of each file included in this repository:
* `analyses.R`: The full R script for all of the analyses in the manuscript. Each subsection of the paper has a corresponding subsection in the analysis script, with cleaning procedures, models, and plotting.
* `pre_new.csv`,`post1_new.csv`,`post2_new.csv`,`post3_new.csv`: The cleaned data files from Qualtrics surveys. This study included surveys at four timepoints: one before the election (`pre_new.csv`), and the other three are from after the election.
* `events.csv`: The reported episodic memories from the Qualtrics survey. This is only needed for the semantic similarity analysis.
