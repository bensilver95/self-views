# self-views
This is the repository for the paper titled “Did I really used to be like that?” Self-views and memory across the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

In this repository, you can find the R analysis script and all of the data that goes into the analysis script, in the form of cleaned .csv files from Qualtrics surveys. If you'd like to view and work with the .RData file, which includes all models and figures, you can find that on the [OSF]() page.
